define2
=======

This lets you download and query an offline dump of Wiktionary.

Wiktionary has English definitions for any word in any language. Great for when you have no internet access, or when you want to impress/become a local polyglot.

Found a missing word in your obscure Lojban dialect? Add it to [Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) and it should appear in a few weeks.

# Usage

First, download the dump and generate the database using make-word-db.py.

Then, define2.py [word] to query the database. Symlink it to ~/bin and add it to your PATH or something.

Easy!
